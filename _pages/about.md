I am a 15-year-old student at Palo Alto High School and a research intern at Stanford University. I am conducting AI research to solve healthcare problems at the point-of-care through accessible innovations. I am leading various research efforts and have authored several scientific research publications. I have presented my work at various leading conferences. I am also an iOS app developer and have 4 apps on the App Store. I am a WWDC Scholar ('20, '21), ISEF Grand Awardee ('22), and SigmaXi Top Presenter ('22). I am the founder and CEO of Aretech Inc., a non-profit which aims to solve real-world problems through mobile apps and I am also leading an app development course initiative for kids. I also serve as the board member of the Get Involved Foundation where I develop apps that support community service initiatives.
