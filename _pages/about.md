I am a 15-year-old student research intern @ [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I am conducting research with the goal of solving healthcare problems at the point-of-care through AI and accessible innovations. I am leading various research efforts and have authored several scientific research publications. I have presented my work at various leading conferences. I am also an iOS app developer and have [5 apps on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/sangeetha-rao/id1509888759). I am a WWDC Scholar ('20, '21), ISEF Grand Awardee ('22), and SigmaXi Top Presenter ('22). I am the founder and CEO of [Aretech Inc.](http://xn--artech-4ua.com/), a non-profit which aims to solve real-world problems through mobile apps and I am also leading an app development course initiative for kids. I also serve as the board member of the Get Involved Foundation where I develop apps that support community service initiatives.
