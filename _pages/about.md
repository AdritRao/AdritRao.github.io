I am a 16-year-old student research intern @ [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I am passionate about conducting research at the intersection of AI, healthcare, and mobile apps. I have authored several publications and presented at various conferences. I am a WWDC Scholar ('20, '21), ISEF Grand Awardee ('22), and Sigma Xi Member & Top Presenter ('22). I am the founder and CEO of [Aretech Inc.](http://xn--artech-4ua.com/), a non-profit which aims to solve real-world problems through mobile apps and I am also leading an app development course initiative for kids. I also serve as the board member of the [Get Involved Foundation where](https://www.getinvolvedfoundation.org) I develop apps that support community service initiatives.
